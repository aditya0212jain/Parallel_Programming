## KMeans_Clustering
Assignment 1 for the COL380 . Implementation of KMeans algorithm in three versions sequential , using Pthreads and using OpenMP.

# Compiling and Testing using makefile provided
a Makefile is created for simpler compilation and testing of all the codes
Variables:
1)NUM set this to the total number of datapoints in the dataset file
2)BLOB set this to the number of clusters 
3)SEQ_EXEC, PTH_EXEC , OMP_EXEC corresponds to the executables name after compilation 
by default they are set to be seq , parP and parOmp

The makefile expects that the datafile is in format generated by the dataset.py 

It further has two targets compil and getstats . compil is for compiling and getstats runs the executable for 
2,3,5,6,8,10,16 and 32 threads one by one

Example :
setting NUM=5000 and BLOB=3 will run the file dataset_5000_3.txt and produce outputs in seq_a.txt seq_b.txt and others as well.

make :- this will compile the files

make clean :- this will clean all the executables and the output produced using getstats target

# compiling manually
If you wish to compile it manually then set the following flags :
for pthread: -lpthread
for openmp: -fopenmp
and -lgomp for using omp_get_wtime() in the main files

There are only three main files namely lab1_sequential.cpp , lab1_pthread.cpp and lab1_omp.cpp
created by me

# Extra data apart from report and code
The excel sheet containing all the observations is provided in data.ods file 
Also the classifications of the dataset used in the observation is visualised using the script written in Stats.ipynb file
and the visualizations are also present in the folder named visualizations. x_n_a.png denotes that it was created using x code
on n datapoints with 'a' blobs.It can be seen that k means get stuck in local minima in large datasets :)

Notes: some extra files like eplot.txt were created for assisstance in visualization
